### Tongren
 The Tongren clinical dataset contains 30 representative retinal fundus images
with a 45 ̊ FOV and a resolution of 1888×2816 pixels, within which 20 images were normal,
10 images with moderate cataract or retinal diseases including glaucoma, age related macular
degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion. An approval was obtained from the Ethics
Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital. The ocular fundus had been taken with a fundus
camera (CR6-45NM Camera, Canon Inc., Ota, Tokyo, Japan). These images were labeled by
two experienced ophthalmologists with the ITK-SNAP toolkit (Yushkevich et al., 2006). For
each category, a half images are used for training and the rest are used for testing.

### Kailuan
 The Kailuan database contains 30 images which were collected from
participants of the community-based Kailuan Cohort Study (Jiang et al., 2015). These images
have different sizes. The minimum, average, and maximum height are 1588, 1902, 2112. The
minimum, average, and maximum width are 1586, 1901, 2112. We use 15 images for training
and the rest for testing. As well, these images were labeled by experienced ophthalmologist
with the ITK-SNAP toolkit (Yushkevich et al., 2006).
